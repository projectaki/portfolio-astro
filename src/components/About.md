I am a fullstack software engineer. My main interest lies in **algorithms**, but I also have fundamental knowledge in many areas of software to create **apps**. This includes **databases** | **apis** | **authentication** | **SaaS services** | **cloud hosting**.

For the first year of my professional career, I have focused on gaining **full-stack** experience. I did this because I wanted to be able to bring ideas to life from back &rarr; front.

In the future I plan to focus on the **backend**, where my main interest lies, but keep my full-stack knowledge up to date.
